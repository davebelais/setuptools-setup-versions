    # type: (Optional[str], Optional[str]) -> bool
    """
    Update setup.py installation requirements to (at minimum) require the
    version of each referenced package which is currently installed.

    Parameters:

        package_directory_or_setup_script (str):

            The directory containing the package. This directory must include a
            file named "setup.py".

        operator (str):

            An operator such as '>=' or '==' which will be applied to all
            package requirements. If not provided, existing operators will
            be used and only package version numbers will be updated.

    Returns:

         `True` if changes were made to setup.py, otherwise `False`
